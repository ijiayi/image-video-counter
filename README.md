Quickly count the number of image and video files within a directory (and its subdirectories), along with their total sizes.

## Features

- Counts the total number of files, image files, and video files separately.
- Calculates the total size of images and videos.
- Recursively analyzes subdirectories.
- Excludes specific folders (e.g., those named "#recycle" or "@eaDir").

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Download the `file_counter.py` file.

## Usage

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you saved the `file_counter.py` file.
3. Execute the following command, replacing `/path/to/analyze` with the actual path you want to analyze:

   ```bash
   python file_counter.py /path/to/analyze
   ```
